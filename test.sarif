However, if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker may be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting the resource pool.\n\nExample: The following method never closes the file handle it opens. The finalize() method for FileInputStream eventually calls close(), but there is no guarantee as to how long it will take before the finalize() method will be invoked. In a busy environment, this can result in the JVM using up all of its file handles.\n\nprivate void processFile(String fName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fName);\nint sz;\nbyte[] byteArray = new byte[BLOCK_SIZE];\nwhile ((sz = fis.read(byteArray)) != -1) {\nprocessBytes(byteArray, sz);\n}\n}"
